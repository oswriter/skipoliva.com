# Do You Need Help Writing a Blog?

I have been writing legal and business content for the web since 2000. Currently I ghostwrite for more than a dozen law firm blogs, covering subjects from personal injury and bankruptcy to criminal defense and intellectual property. Previously, I spent more than a decade working as a paralegal and writing about antitrust law for a nonprofit organization. If you need an affordable, experienced writer to help create or improve your own blog, [contact me](https://skipoliva.com/#contact) today.
