# Do You Need Help Writing a Blog?

I have over 16 years experience writing for the web. Currently I ghostwrite content for more than a dozen law blogs, covering subjects from personal injury and bankruptcy to criminal defense and intellectual property. Previously, I spent over a decade working as a paralegal and writing about antitrust law for a nonprofit organization. If you need an affordable, experienced writer to help create or improve your own blog, contact me today.
