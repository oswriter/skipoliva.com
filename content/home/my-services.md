# Custom Content for Your Blog

Blogging is an important tool for promoting a business. Unlike newer forms of social media, blogging draws potential customers to *your* website rather than a third-party platform. A blog also allows you to demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments within your industry.

But while many small businesses and law firms start blogs, they often end up gathering virtual dust after just a few months. It's not that blogging is difficult, or that your business lacks potential content. It's just that blogging requires time and effort you would rather devote to serving your existing customers.

This is where I can help. I've been blogging professionally since 2000--before the term "blog" entered the popular lexicon. I've served a number of professional clients, ranging from nonprofit public policy groups to college football websites. I know how to research and write timely content that will ensure your blog never goes stale.

## How Blog Ghostwriting Works

Every business and blog setup is unique. I've had some clients who like to update their blogs 2 or 3 times per week, and others who only do so twice a month. The right blogging schedule depends on a number of factors, including the types of services you offer, how much news there is about your industry, and your budget for ghostwriting services.

Whatever your needs, [contact me](https://skipoliva.com/#contact) today so we can work together and develop a custom ghostwriting package for your business. As far as the final content is concerned, you will retain full ownership and copyright over all paid work-for-hire.
