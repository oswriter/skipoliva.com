Ohio law permits a personal injury plaintiff to seek punitive damages when there is evidence of "malice" on the part of the defendant. As explained by the [Ohio Supreme Court](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7490791315894758294), malice encompasses not only acts motivated by "hatred, ill will, or a spirit of revenge," but also "extremely reckless behavior revealing a conscious disregard for a great and obvious harm." 

When a plaintiff asks for punitive damages, the judge is required to conduct the trial in two parts. The first part of the trial is for the presentation of evidence related to compensatory damages--i.e., the injuries directly sustained by the plaintiff. If the jury decides to award compensatory damages, then the trial proceeds to the second stage: determination of punitive damages. In general, a jury may award no more than "two times the amount of compensatory damages awarded" as punitive damages. In other words, if the jury decides the plaintiff is entitled to $50,000 in compensatory damages, the defendant may not be held liable for more than $100,000 in punitive damages.

Although the trial judge agreed with the plaintiff such an award was not excessive, the appellate court said it clearly violated state law.

The underlying case is itself somewhat unusual. In December 2012, the plaintiff was shopping at the defendant's grocery store. Another customer riding a store-provided motorized scooter collided with the plaintiff's shopping cart. This forced the latter cart into the plaintiff, knocking her to the ground. According to the plaintiff's subsequent [personal injury lawsuit](https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/10/cleveland_woman_wins_12_millio.html), she "struck her head against a shelf display and suffered neck and head injuries."

The plaintiff sued the store on the grounds that it was negligent in training and supervising customers in the use of its motorized carts. At trial, the plaintiff presented evidence of 179 prior accidents involving such carts at the defendant's stores. Despite this history, the store failed to
